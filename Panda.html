                <h3>GIANT PANDA</h3>
                <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a bear native to south central China. It is characterized by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda.</p>
                <p>Pandas live mainly in temperate forests high in the mountains of southwest China, where they subsist almost entirely on bamboo. They must eat 26 to 84 pounds of it every day, depending on what part of the bamboo they are eating.</p>
                <p>Despite being herbivorous, pandas retain a digestive system typical of carnivores and derive little energy from the bamboo they consume. As a result, they are generally sedentary, conserving energy by moving slowly and resting for up to 14 hours per day.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                <p>Our panda habitat is located in the Asian Forest zone (Pen C12), featuring a climate-controlled environment with plenty of bamboo and climbing structures.</p>
