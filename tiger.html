                <h3>BENGAL TIGER</h3>
                <p>The Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) is the most numerous tiger subspecies in Asia. These magnificent cats are known for their orange coats with distinctive black stripes and white undersides. Adult males can weigh up to 260 kg (570 lb) and measure nearly 3 meters (10 ft) in length.</p>
                <p>Tigers are solitary hunters and primarily nocturnal. They have excellent night vision and can swim well, often cooling off in ponds and streams during hot days. Their striped coats provide perfect camouflage in tall grasses and forest shadows.</p>
                <p>These apex predators mainly hunt deer, wild boar, and other large mammals. A single tiger can eat up to 40 kg (88 lb) of meat in one meal, then go without eating for several days.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                <p>Our tiger enclosure is located in the Asian Forest zone (Pen A12), featuring a recreated jungle environment with pools, rocks, and dense vegetation.</p>
