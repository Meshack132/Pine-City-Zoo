                <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                <p>The gemsbok (Oryx gazella) is a large antelope native to the arid regions of Southern Africa. With their striking black and white facial markings and long, straight horns, gemsbok are one of the most distinctive antelope species. Both males and females have horns, which can grow up to 85 cm (33 in) long.</p>
                <p>Gemsbok are well-adapted to desert life and can survive without water for extended periods, getting moisture from the plants they eat. They primarily feed on grasses, leaves, and wild melons. Their pale gray coat reflects sunlight, helping them stay cool in the harsh desert environment.</p>
                <p>These antelope are known for their impressive defensive capabilities. When threatened, they use their long, sharp horns to protect themselves from predators like lions and hyenas. Gemsbok can run at speeds up to 60 km/h (37 mph) when escaping danger.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                <p>You will find the gemsbok in the African Savannah exhibit, near the western edge of the zoo (Pen S14).</p>
