                <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                <p>The giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Adult males can reach heights of up to 5.5 meters (18 feet), with their long necks accounting for much of this height. Each giraffe's coat pattern is unique, much like human fingerprints.</p>
                <p>Giraffes primarily feed on leaves, fruits and flowers of woody plants, especially acacia species, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach. Their long tongues (about 45 cm/18 in) help them pull leaves from branches, while thick saliva protects them from thorns.</p>
                <p>Despite their size, giraffes are vulnerable to predators like lions when drinking or lying down. They defend themselves with powerful kicks that can kill a lion. Giraffes only need 5-30 minutes of sleep in a 24-hour period, often standing up.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                <p>You will find our giraffes in the African Plains exhibit (Pen A03), near the main entrance. Our observation deck allows you to feed them at scheduled times.</p>
