                <h3>LION</h3>
                <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. Adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane.</p>
                <p>Lions inhabit grasslands, savannas, and shrublands. They are more social than other big cats, living in groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Females typically do the hunting, while males patrol the territory and protect the pride.</p>
                <p>Lions are apex predators and keystone predators, meaning they play a crucial role in their ecosystem. Their prey consists mainly of mammals, particularly ungulates weighing 190-550 kg (420-1,210 lb).</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                <p>Our lion pride can be seen in the African Savannah exhibit (Pen A05), featuring rocky outcrops and watering holes that mimic their natural habitat.</p>
