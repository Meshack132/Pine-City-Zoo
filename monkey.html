                <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
                <p>Monkeys are a diverse group of primates that include over 260 known living species. They are generally divided into two groups: Old World monkeys (from Africa and Asia) and New World monkeys (from Central and South America).</p>
                <p>Most monkeys have opposable thumbs and forward-facing eyes that give them depth perception. They are known for their intelligence and social behavior. Many species live in trees (arboreal), although some live primarily on the ground.</p>
                <p>Monkeys communicate through vocalizations, facial expressions, and body movements. Their diets vary by species but often include fruits, leaves, seeds, nuts, flowers, eggs, and small animals.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                <p>Our monkey exhibits are located in the Primate Pavilion (Pens P1-P4), featuring species from around the world in naturalistic habitats with climbing structures and enrichment activities.</p>
