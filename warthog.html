                <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                <p>The warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) is a wild member of the pig family found in grassland, savanna, and woodland in sub-Saharan Africa. These sturdy animals are named for the four large wart-like protrusions on their faces, which serve as fat reserves and protection during fights.</p>
                <p>Warthogs are surprisingly fast runners and will often back into their burrows when threatened, keeping their tusks facing outward for defense. They kneel on their calloused, padded knees to feed on grasses, roots, berries, and occasionally carrion.</p>
                <p>Their large tusks are actually elongated canine teeth that curve upwards. Males use these tusks for fighting during mating season and for digging up roots and bulbs.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                <p>Our warthog family lives in the African Savannah exhibit (Pen D08), sharing space with meerkats in a habitat that mimics their natural environment.</p>
