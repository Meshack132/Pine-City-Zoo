                <h3>KOALA</h3>
                <p>The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats.</p>
                <p>Koalas are known for their teddy bear-like appearance, with a stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears. They have sharp claws for climbing and a specialized digestive system that allows them to eat toxic eucalyptus leaves.</p>
                <p>Koalas sleep about 20 hours a day due to their low-energy diet. They are mostly active at night and spend most of their waking hours feeding. Despite their cute appearance, koalas have a loud, deep growl and can be aggressive when disturbed.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                <p>Our koala habitat is located in the Australian Outback exhibit (Pen B07), featuring eucalyptus trees and a climate-controlled environment to keep them comfortable year-round.</p>
