                <h3>MOUNTAIN GORILLA</h3>
                <p>The mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei) is one of the two subspecies of the eastern gorilla. These magnificent primates are the largest living primates, with males reaching up to 1.8 m (5 ft 11 in) in height and weighing up to 220 kg (485 lb).</p>
                <p>Gorillas live in stable family groups led by a dominant silverback male. They are primarily herbivorous, feeding on leaves, shoots, stems, and occasionally fruit. Despite their size and strength, gorillas are generally gentle and shy.</p>
                <p>These intelligent animals use tools in the wild and have been observed displaying human-like emotions. They communicate through vocalizations, body postures, and facial expressions. Each gorilla has a unique nose print, similar to human fingerprints.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                <p>Our gorilla habitat is located in the Primate Sanctuary (Pen P05), featuring a naturalistic environment with climbing structures, waterfalls, and viewing areas that allow you to observe these amazing creatures up close.</p>
